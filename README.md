YouTubeDimmer
=============
This is a project designed to 'dim' the YouTube background while watching videos.
To get started, follow these instructions:  
1. Bookmark this page. Yes you have to.  
2. Go to [This page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thislooksfun/YouTubeDimmer/master/BookmarkletScript) and copy the entire page.  
3. Edit that bookmark you made, and paste what you just copied into the "address" part.  
4. Rename the bookmark whatever you want.  
5. Go to <http://youtube.com>, choose a video, and click that bookmark!  
6. To turn it off, simply press escape. If it doesn't work, try again. You might have had something selected. If it doesn't work after three tries, simply reload the page.  

If you wish to install [my other project](https://github.com/thislooksfun/YouTubeNightMode) at the same time, (I don't see why you would, as it's very much not finished, but if you do), follow the instructions above, but use [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thislooksfun/YouTubeDimmer/master/DualInstallationBookmarkletScript) instead when you get to number 2.
