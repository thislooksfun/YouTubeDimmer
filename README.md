YouTubeDimmer
=============
This is a project designed to 'dim' the YouTube background while watching videos.
To get started, simply drag [this link](javascript:(function(\){if(document.getElementById('dimmerScript'\)==null\){var js=document.createElement('script'\);js.setAttribute('type','text/javascript'\);js.setAttribute('id','dimmerScript'\);js.setAttribute('src','https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thislooksfun/YouTubeDimmer/master/Dimmer.js'\);document.head.appendChild(js\);}}(\)\)) to your bookmark bar. Go to any YouTube video, and click that bookmark! To turn it off, simply press escape. If it doesn't work after three tries, simply reload the page.  

If you wish to install [my other project](https://github.com/thislooksfun/YouTubeNightMode) at the same time, (I don't see why you would, as it's very much not finished, but if you do,) follow the instructions above, but use [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thislooksfun/YouTubeDimmer/master/DualInstallationBookmarkletScript) instead.
